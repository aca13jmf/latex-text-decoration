# Latex Text Decoration

This package provides key commands for adding latex text decorations such as `\emph` to selected text. So far we have:

| Command       | Shortcut      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `\emph{}`     | ctrl-alt-e    |
| `\textbf{}`   | ctrl-alt-b    |
| `\mathit{}`   | ctrl-alt-m    |

I will likely add others as I need them.
